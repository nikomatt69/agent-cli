# AGENTS DEEP ANALYSIS

Extended notes and deep-dive on agent behaviors for nikcli-main.

- Dependency scanning encountered parameter issue: temperature value 0 unsupported by model; default 1 used.
- Code quality scans on directories dist/cli/core, dist/cli/chat, and bin failed due to directory handling; need file-level targets.
- Proposed automation: target source code (src/) for quality checks; avoid dist/ for lint/metrics.
- Added new agent-related files in src/cli/ui and dist/cli/ui.

Next steps:

- Re-run analysis on clean targets.
- Expand agent tests to cover error boundaries and edge-cases.
