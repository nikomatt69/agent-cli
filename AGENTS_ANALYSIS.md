# AGENTS ANALYSIS

Overview and summary of automated agents analysis for nikcli-main project.

Key insights:

- Large monorepo with many build artifacts and dist outputs.
- Active development on multiple fronts (CLI, UI, AI agents).
- Dependency surface: production 51, dev 22, total 72.
- Build outputs across platforms (nikcli binaries) included in repo.
- Recent commits include new agent-related files and UI components.

Risks:

- Build artifacts inside repo can cause drift between source and artifacts, bloating repo.
- Incomplete dependency analysis due to model parameter issue.
- Many changes staged for commit; need clean PR flow.

Recommendations:

- Separate build outputs from source (consider publish artifacts to a dist/ package or ignore/build pipelines).
- Re-run dependency analysis with safe model params.
- Adopt feature branches and PR workflow for changes.
- Improve test coverage for critical areas (core, chat, context).
