## 💻 Real-World Workflows

### **Workflow 1: New Project Setup**
```bash
# Start with empty directory
mkdir my-awesome-app && cd my-awesome-app

# Launch Claude Code Clone
claude-code-clone chat

# Auto-create full project
> /auto Create a Next.js e-commerce app with:
> - Product catalog with search and filters

> - GitHub Actions CI/CD

# The full-stack-developer agent will create everything!
```

### **Workflow 2: Code Review and Optimization**
```bash
# Open existing project
cd existing-project
claude-code-clone chat

# Get expert review
> @code-reviewer Analyze this codebase for performance and security issues

# Then optimize
> @optimization-agent Fix the performance issues identified
> @testing-specialist Add tests for the security-critical parts
```

### **Workflow 3: Feature Addition**
```bash
# Add new feature to existing app
> @react-expert Add a real-time chat feature to this app
> @backend-engineer Create WebSocket API for the chat
> @testing-specialist Add tests for chat functionality  
> @devops-engineer Update deployment for WebSocket support
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage Patterns

### **Agent Chaining**
```bash
# Use different agents in sequence
> @backend-engineer Create user authentication API
< ✅ Authentication API created

> @react-expert Create login/signup forms for this API  
< ✅ Authentication forms created

> @testing-specialist Add tests for auth flow
< ✅ Authentication tests added

> @devops-engineer Add auth to Docker setup
< ✅ Docker configuration updated
```

### **Interactive Development**
```bash
# Work interactively with agents
> @react-expert Create a data visualization component

< I'll create a chart component. What type of chart do you need?
< Available options: line chart, bar chart, pie chart, scatter plot...

> Line chart with zoom and tooltip features

< Perfect! Creating a line chart with:
< - Zoom/pan functionality
< - Interactive tooltips  
< - Responsive design
< - TypeScript interfaces
< - Custom styling options
```

### **Context-Aware Assistance**
```bash
# The AI automatically understands your project
> Add user authentication

# In a React project:
< I see this is a React/Next.js project. I'll add:
< - Next-auth configuration
< - Login/signup pages  
< - Protected route middleware
< - Session management hooks

# In a Node.js API project:
< I see this is a Node.js API. I'll add:
< - JWT token authentication
< - User model and endpoints
< - Middleware for route protection
< - Password hashing with bcrypt
```

## 📊 Performance Examples

### **Before Claude Code Clone**
```bash
# Traditional development:
# 1. Plan architecture (30 mins)
# 2. Set up project structure (45 mins)  
# 3. Create components (2-3 hours)
# 4. Add styling (1 hour)
# 5. Add tests (1 hour)
# 6. Set up CI/CD (1 hour)
# Total: ~6 hours for basic setup
```

### **With Claude Code Clone**
```bash
# AI-assisted development:
> /auto Create a complete React dashboard with authentication, charts, 
> responsive design, tests, and CI/CD pipeline

# Result: Complete application ready in 5-10 minutes! 🚀
```

## 🎨 Customization Examples

### **Model Switching**
```bash
# Switch between AI models for different needs
> /model claude-3-5-sonnet    # Best for complex reasoning
< ✓ Switched to claude-3-5-sonnet

> /model gpt-4                # Good for creative tasks  
< ✓ Switched to gpt-4

> /model gemini-pro           # Fast for simple tasks
< ✓ Switched to gemini-pro
```

### **Agent Preferences**
```bash
# Set preferred agent for auto mode
claude-code-clone config
> preferredAgent: "full-stack-developer"

# Now /auto will default to full-stack-developer
> /auto Add user profile management
🤖 Starting full-stack-developer agent... (preferred)
```

### **Workspace Configuration**
```bash
# Configure for specific project types
> /cd ~/projects/react-native-app
> @react-expert Configure this as React Native project

# Now the agent understands React Native context
> Add navigation with tabs
< Creating React Navigation setup with tab navigator...
```

## 🚀 Pro Tips

### **1. Use Descriptive Requests**
```bash
# ✅ Good:
> Create a user authentication system with email/password login, 
> JWT tokens, password reset functionality, and form validation

# ❌ Less effective:
> Add auth
```

### **2. Leverage Auto Mode for Complex Tasks**
```bash
# ✅ Perfect for auto mode:
> /auto Build a complete e-commerce checkout flow

# ✅ Also good for specific agents:
> @react-expert Optimize this component for performance
```

### **3. Use Agent Mode for Focused Work**
```bash
# Switch to agent mode for multiple related tasks
> /use react-expert
✓ Switched to react-expert agent mode

> Create navigation component
> Add responsive mobile menu  
> Style with Tailwind classes
> Add accessibility features

> /exit-agent
```

### **4. Combine File Operations**
```bash
# Read existing code first
> Read the current user model and enhance it with profile pictures

< Reading src/models/User.ts...
< I see your current user model. I'll enhance it with:
< - Profile picture URL field
< - Image upload validation  
< - Avatar component
< - Image optimization utilities
```

### **5. Use Context Commands**
```bash
> /pwd                    # Check current directory
> /ls                     # See available files
> /cd src/components      # Navigate to components
> @react-expert Create button component here
```
