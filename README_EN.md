# NikCLI ‚Äì Autonomous AI Terminal Assistant (Claude Code style)

> A modern TypeScript CLI for agent-assisted development with a terminal UI, safe tools, autonomous planning, and multi-model support (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Ollama).

## Introduction

NikCLI is a powerful command-line interface designed to enhance developer productivity by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. It integrates various AI models, allowing users to perform tasks like coding, testing, analysis, and operations efficiently.

### System Requirements

- **Node.js**: >= 18
- **TypeScript**: ^5.3
- **Binary**: `nikcli` (optional `pkg` build for standalone distributions)
- **Configuration Path**: `~/.nikcli/config.json`
- **NPM Package**: `@cadcamfun/nikcli`

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Streaming Terminal UI**: Provides an interactive interface with intuitive slash commands (`/help`, `/model`, `/agents`, ...).
- **Enterprise Universal Agent**: Capable of end-to-end tasks including coding, analysis, refactoring, testing, and DevOps processes.
- **Safe Tool System**: Implements secure read/write file operations, command execution, and approvals before critical actions.
- **Advanced Planning & Orchestration**: Features autonomous and parallel task management, including an integrated diff viewer for reviewing changes.
- **Pluggable AI Providers**: Supports multiple AI providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and Ollama, with some options for local execution without API keys.
- **Persistent User Configuration**: Utilizes a validated configuration schema for maintaining user preferences and settings.

## üöÄ Installation

### Option A ‚Äì Local Development

To set up NikCLI for local development, execute the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
./bin/nikcli
```

### Option B ‚Äì Quickstart via Curl (Global, Beta)

For a quick installation, see the `installer/README.md`. Example commands are as follows:

```bash
# Latest beta version
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikomatt69/agent-cli/main/installer/install.sh | bash

# Specific version installation
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikomatt69/agent-cli/main/installer/install.sh | bash -s -- --version 0.1.0-beta
```

To uninstall NikCLI:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikomatt69/agent-cli/main/installer/uninstall.sh | bash
```

> **Note**: The installer uses `npm i -g`. Using npm is preferred over yarn.

---

## ‚ö° Quickstart Guide

Run the interactive interface with:

```bash
nikcli
```

Alternatively, you can start it from the repository if you're in development mode:

```bash
./bin/nikcli
```

### Quick Example Commands

Here are some example commands to get you started:

```text
/help                    # List available commands
/model claude-sonnet-4-20250514
/set-key claude-sonnet-4-20250514 sk-ant-...
/read src/cli/index.ts
/grep "ModelProvider"
/run "npm test"
```

---

## ü§ñ Supported Models

The following models are available by default:
| Name | Provider | Model | Requires API key |
|--------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|------------------|
| claude-sonnet-4-20250514 | Anthropic | claude-sonnet-4-20250514 | Yes |
| claude-3-haiku-20240229 | Anthropic | claude-3-haiku-20240229 | Yes |
| gpt-4o-mini | OpenAI | gpt-4o-mini | Yes |
| gpt-5 | OpenAI | gpt-5 | Yes |
| gpt-4o | OpenAI | gpt-4o | Yes |
| gpt-4.1 | OpenAI | gpt-4.1 | Yes |
| gpt-4 | OpenAI | gpt-4 | Yes |
| gpt-3.5-turbo | OpenAI | gpt-3.5-turbo | Yes |
| gpt-3.5-turbo-16k | OpenAI | gpt-3.5-turbo-16k | Yes |

### Change Model Command

Use the command `/model <name>` to change the model. To view the list of available models, type `/models`. To set an API key for a specific model, use `/set-key <model> <key>`. Note that Ollama does not require keys; ensure that `ollama serve` is running on the default host `127.0.0.1:11434`.

---

## üîß Configuration

The configuration file is located at `~/.nikcli/config.json` and follows a predefined schema. For details, refer to `src/cli/core/config-manager.ts`.

### Minimal Configuration Example

```json
{
  "currentModel": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "maxTokens": 4000,
  "chatHistory": true,
  "maxHistoryLength": 100,
  "systemPrompt": null,
  "autoAnalyzeWorkspace": true,
  "enableAutoApprove": false,
  "models": {
    /* defaults included */
  },
  "apiKeys": {},
  "mcpServers": {},
  "maxConcurrentAgents": 3,
  "enableGuidanceSystem": true,

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY="..."
# Ollama: no key, optional OLLAMA_HOST

## üîí Security and Approvals

The security framework includes the following features:

- UI approval system for sensitive actions, including network access, command execution, and file modifications.
- Configurable sandbox settings in `config.json` (check options like `sandbox.enabled`, `allowNetwork`, `allowCommands`, etc.).
- Execution policies defined in `src/cli/policies/` to enforce secure interactions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The main directory structure is as follows:

```
src/cli/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai/                     # Handles Providers and ModelProvider
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ automation/             # Manages Agents and orchestration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chat/                   # Contains chat interfaces and slash commands
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context/                # Responsible for RAG and workspace context
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/                   # Core configurations, logger, agent manager, data types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/               # Provides Agent, Tool, Planning, and LSP services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/                  # Implements safe tools with a registry
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/                     # User Interface management including diff and approvals
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts                # Unified entry point for streaming orchestration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ unified-cli.ts          # Launcher for Claude-like interface
```

### Key Components:

- `ModelProvider` located in `src/cli/ai/model-provider.ts`: Integrates functionalities from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and Ollama (including streaming).
- `SimpleConfigManager` in `src/cli/core/config-manager.ts`: Manages loading and saving configurations with Zod validation.
- `AgentManager` in `src/cli/core/agent-manager.ts`: Handles the agent lifecycle and management.
- Includes components for the `approval-system` and `diff-manager` to make user experience better and efficient.
- Command mappings are defined in `nik-cli-commands.ts`, managing the functionality of `/...` commands.

npm test
npm run lint
```

To build the standalone binary (optional), use:

```bash
npm run build:bin      # auto-detect targets
npm run build:bin:mac   # macOS (arm64/x64)
npm run build:bin:linux  # Linux
dist/nikcli # or just 'dist/nikcli' to execute the binary
```

## üß© Integrations and LSP Support

- Language Server Protocol (LSP) and JSON-RPC are implemented in `src/cli/lsp/` and utilize `vscode-jsonrpc`.
- The MCP client placeholder can be found in `src/cli/core/mcp-client.ts`, with full MCP server support planned for future releases.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter issues, check the following:

- Ensure your Node version is >= 18.
- API keys not set: you may need to use `/set-key` or set them as environment variables.
- If the Ollama model is unreachable, make sure to start `ollama serve` or the app and set the `OLLAMA_HOST` appropriately.
- For TypeScript build issues, run `rm -rf dist && npm run build` to clean and rebuild.
- If you experience script permission errors, try running `chmod +x bin/nikcli` to ensure execution permissions.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Short Roadmap for Future Features

Future enhancements may include:

- An interactive step-wise reader for large files that supports range selections.
- Complete integration of a client-side MCP server.
- Support for external extensions, plugins, and an API gateway to facilitate more extensive features.
